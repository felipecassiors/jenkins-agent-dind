A full fledged Docker in Docker image to act as a Jenkins Agent. Based on [buildpack-deps:bionic](https://github.com/docker-library/buildpack-deps/blob/master/bionic/Dockerfile), it is a mashup of [jenkins/slave](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-slave/blob/master/Dockerfile) with [docker:dind](https://github.com/docker-library/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile-dind.template).

- Source code: <https://github.com/felipecrs/jenkins-agent-dind>
- Docker image: <https://hub.docker.com/r/felipecrs/jenkins-agent-dind>

## Features

- Based on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic: a more common OS to run your builds.
- From `buildpack-deps`: a image with many common dependencies installed, run your builds without hassle.
- It contains the latest release of `agent.jar`: even more up-to-date then jenkins/slave itself.
- Fully working Docker in Docker: run your `docker build` commands with no intervention and share of resources between the host.
- Act just as a Jenkins Slave out-of-the-box: run ephemeral build containers by using Docker Plugin for Jenkins.

## Usage

### Command line

Spin this agent in shell, if you want to play with it:

```sh
# Fetches the latest version
docker pull felipecrs/jenkins-agent-dind
# -ti: allocates a pseudo-TTY in order to run the command, which is bash
# --rm: removes the container after using it (don't forget to remove the volumes created by it)
# --privileged: needed for running Docker in Docker
docker run -ti --rm --privileged felipecrs/jenkins-agent-dind bash
```
